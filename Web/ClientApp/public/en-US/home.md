## Welcome to Unia!
###### The software package that allows you to process data, connect disparate systems, create applications that have a Web interface that unites everything and everyone.

###### Building using:
* [ASP.NET Core](https://get.asp.net/) and [C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx) для мультиплатформенного серверного кода,
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for single page client-side application,
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for layout and styling.
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for documentation, look [API](/swagger/index.html).

##### Conception of Unia:
* Severe-side sowfware on **ASP.NET Core (.NET Core/C#)**.
* Interacts with the basic interface part written in **TypeScript (HTML5/JavaScript/React)**
* And third-party programs written on various platforms, preferably **.NET/.NET Core/Node.js**.
* Connection tasks (**ITask**) with some connectors (**IConnector**) perform continuous data transfer between different Web platforms, working on the server..
* Client applications from a simple informer of server process to **ERP system** provide complete information and control to end users.

###### The flexibility and completeness of the concept gives an undeniable advantage to any *Web* solutions.
